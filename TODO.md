# Wiki Backlog — @dds/ageofabundance-wiki

The wiki site is built as a consumer of `@dds/renderer` and the Universal
Section schema. Wiki-specific behavior is shipped as local components / data
inside `apps/ageofabundance-wiki/` that consume `UniversalSection`-shaped
data. The core renderer is never forked.

Each item below is scoped to be shippable in a single focused session.

## P0 — Content primitive foundation

- [x] **Wiki article primitive** — static seed dataset of UniversalSection
  articles, dynamic `/a/[slug]` route, featured-articles homepage,
  `not-found.jsx`, long-form typography tokens, Playwright golden-path test.
  _Shipped: see session log below._
- [ ] **Article metadata schema** — formalize `meta.wiki` fields
  (`lastUpdatedISO`, `authors[]`, `readingTimeMinutes`, `wordCount`,
  `tags[]`, `summary`) so all downstream features share one source of truth.
  Additive — existing articles continue to parse.
- [ ] **Article index (`/a`)** — paginated list of every article, sorted by
  `lastUpdatedISO`, filterable by tag.
- [ ] **Wiki-link parser** — `[[Page Name]]` and `[[slug|Display Text]]`
  rewriter that resolves to internal `/a/<slug>` links at build time,
  surfaces broken-link warnings, and supports a "broken link" visual state.
- [ ] **Table of contents** — auto-generated from `<h2>`/`<h3>` inside
  article body, sticky sidebar on wide screens, collapsible on mobile.
  Anchor scroll must respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- [ ] **Backlinks panel** — at article footer, list every article that
  links to the current page. Built by inverting the wiki-link graph at
  build time.

## P0 — Navigation & discovery

- [ ] **Categories** — tag pages at `/t/[tag]` listing all articles with
  that tag; tag chips in article header.
- [ ] **Full-text search** — evaluate Pagefind vs Orama vs FlexSearch.
  Target: static-indexed, <150kb bundle, keyboard-driven combobox,
  AA-compliant results listbox.
- [ ] **Recent changes feed** — `/recent` page sorted by `lastUpdatedISO`,
  JSON feed at `/recent.json`.
- [ ] **Random article** — `/random` route that 307-redirects to a
  randomly chosen article slug.

## P1 — Content authoring

- [ ] **MDX pipeline** — `content/articles/*.mdx` authored files with
  frontmatter → UniversalSection at build time. Must not break the JS
  fallback seed dataset.
- [ ] **Code block renderer** — Shiki-highlighted code blocks with copy
  button, `prefers-reduced-motion` safe.
- [ ] **Image figures** — `<figure>` with caption + proper `alt`, lazy
  loaded, responsive via `next/image`.
- [ ] **Infobox primitive** — sidebar card for facts/key-value data,
  renders from `meta.infobox` entries.

## P1 — Revisions & governance

- [ ] **Revision history** — git-derived commit log per article at
  `/a/[slug]/history`.
- [ ] **Edit page stub** — "Edit on GitHub" link on every article.
- [ ] **Contributors strip** — avatars + usernames derived from commit
  history.

## P2 — Polish & performance

- [ ] **Theme variants wired up** — honor `data-theme-variant` on `<html>`
  across the 9 DDS variants. Verify `minimal`, `midnight`, and one vibrant.
- [ ] **Reading progress indicator** — slim top bar driven by scroll.
  `prefers-reduced-motion` must disable animation.
- [ ] **Print stylesheet** — collapse nav/TOC, set linear flow, black-on-
  white, show wiki-link hrefs.
- [ ] **OG image generation** — per-article dynamic OG cards via
  `@vercel/og`.

## Schema extensions (proposed, deferred)

- `meta.wiki` — `{ lastUpdatedISO, authors[], readingTimeMinutes,
  wordCount, tags[], summary, infobox?, toc?: 'auto' | 'off' }`. All fields
  optional; any existing section without `meta.wiki` must still parse.
- `content.wikiLinks` — optional parsed wiki-link graph populated at
  build time for the backlinks feature.
